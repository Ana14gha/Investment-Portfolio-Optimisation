# Investment-Portfolio-Optimisation
A quantitative modelling project applying Linear Programming (LP), Integer Linear Programming (ILP), and Non-Linear Programming (NLP) to optimise an investment portfolio.   The models use real ASX stock data to maximise returns, manage risk, and improve risk-adjusted performance (Sharpe ratio).

## Methods
- **Linear Programming (LP):** Maximises portfolio return while meeting sector allocation and risk group constraints.
- **Integer Linear Programming (ILP):** Selects a fixed number of investments, ensuring diversification across sectors and risk categories.
- **Non-Linear Programming (NLP):**
  - Maximise return within a specified risk limit
  - Minimise portfolio risk while achieving a minimum return
  - Maximise Sharpe ratio for optimal risk-adjusted returns

## Key Outcomes
- LP model achieved a 1.15% return with balanced sector and risk exposure.
- ILP model delivered a 1.21% return by excluding negative-return assets.
- NLP approaches offered tailored strategies:
  - **Sharpe ratio model**: Best for balanced risk-return
  - **Max return model**: Suited to aggressive growth
  - **Min risk model**: Fits conservative investors

## Skills Demonstrated
- Portfolio optimisation using LP, ILP, and NLP
- Risk classification and diversification strategies
- Data-driven investment decision-making
- Application of quantitative modelling to real market data
